Save this script to a file (e.g., monitor_log.sh) and make it executable using chmod +x monitor_log.sh. Then, you can run it from the command line, providing the path to the log file you want to monitor as an argument. For example:

bash
Copy code
./monitor_log.sh /path/to/logfile.log
This shell script continuously monitors the specified log file, printing new entries in real-time. It also performs basic analysis by searching for the keyword 'error' in each log entry and printing the entry if found. You can modify the analyze_log function to perform more complex analysis as needed.
