 ./monitor_log.sh /path/to/logfile.log
This shell script continuously monitors the specified log file, printing new entries in real-time. It also performs basic analysis by searching for the keyword 'error' in each log entry and printing the entry if found. You can modify the analyze_log function to perform more complex analysis as needed.
